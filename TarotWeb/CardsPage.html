            <h2>The Fool</h2>
            <p>
                The Fool Tarot card is a card of potential, new beginnings and innocence.
                This Tarot card shows the highest potential for your life, reaching a state
                of renewal and new beginnings, where each day is an adventure and each moment
                is lived to the fullest. The Fool card represents the beginning of all creativity
                and a desire to accomplish new goals (or to, at least, start the process of working
                towards those goals). The Fool indicates that anything can happen and the opportunities
                are just waiting to be taken advantage of.
            </p>

            <p>
                In a Tarot reading, the Fool represents the need to set forth on a new journey,
                one that is completely unknown and will take you to uncharted territories.
                The Fool is all about new experiences, personal growth, development and adventure.
                The Fool Tarot card asks you to take a ‘leap of faith’ and to trust in the Universe
                in that if you begin a new journey, you will find success. This Fool lives a carefree
                life, free from worry and anxiety. He does not seem to mind if he does not really
                know what lies ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Fool Tarot card may represent a choice to be made—one of vital importance.
                However, there are always many different options available and the choice must be made wisely.
                If you are facing a decision or moment of doubt, the Fool encourages you to believe in yourself
                and follow your heart no matter how crazy or foolish your impulses may seem. This is a time when
                you need to truly ‘believe’ and have faith in where the Universe is taking you.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Fool is an excellent Tarot card to meditate on if you are experiencing a lot of fear in your
                life. The Fool enhances courage, risk-taking and the creative expression needed to open up new
                areas in your life.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Fool is always whole, healthy and without fear. He is the spirit of who we are,
                the spirit expressed and experienced as wonder, awe, curiosity and anticipation.
                We never know what is in the future but like the Fool we must blindly go forward.
                You need to trust that you are a spirit born into flesh to enjoy life and grow in experience.
                Take a chance and see what happens.
